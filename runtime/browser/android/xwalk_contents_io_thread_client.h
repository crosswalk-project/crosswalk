// the URLRequest is made for.
//
// The native class is intended to be a short-lived handle that pins the
// Java-side instance. It is preferable to use the static getter methods to
// obtain a new instance of the class rather than holding on to one for
// prolonged periods of time (see note for more details).

// Note: The native AwContentsIoThreadClient instance has a Global ref to
// the Java object. By keeping the native AwContentsIoThreadClient
// instance alive you're also prolonging the lifetime of the Java instance, so
// don't keep a AwContentsIoThreadClient if you don't need to.
