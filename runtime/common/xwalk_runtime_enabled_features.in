//
// This list is used to generate XWalkRuntimeEnabledFeatures.h/cc which contains
// a class that stores static enablers for all experimental features.
//
// Each feature can be assigned a "status":
// status=stable -> Enable this in all XWalk configurations.  We are committed to these APIs/features indefinitely.
// status=experimental -> In-progress features, developers might play with, but are not on by default in stable.
// Features without a status are not enabled anywhere by default.
//
// "stable" features listed here should be rare, as anything which we've shipped stable
// can have its runtime flag removed soon after.

XWalkRunAsService status=experimental, text="run-as-service", description="Runs Crosswalk in service mode. It loads no application by default but stays alive and listens for external requests to launch applications."
