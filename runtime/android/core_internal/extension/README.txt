java files in this folder is moved from .../runtime/android/core_internal/src/.../internal/extension.
The build-in extensions can be conditionally set to disable/enable before compiling by using flag "disable_android_buildin_extensions = 0/1". 
so the java files in this folder won't be compiled if the build-in extensions are disabled.
