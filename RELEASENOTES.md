## Crosswalk 16 (Jan 11, 2016)

* Update to Chromium 45, which includes new JavaScript language features, an improved audio experience on Android, and a large number of minor API improvements and deprecations. Read the [announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2015/07/chrome-45-beta-new-es2015-features.html) for more details.
* Crosswalk can now play back Widevine DRM-protected content ([XWALK-5030](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-5030))
* A new xwalk_view.background_color field can be added to the manifest.json, to specify the background color of the XWalkView

* The signature of the downloaded Crosswalk APK is verified when starting the application in shared mode.
* Android support libraries (e.g. support-v4, support-v7 etc) are no longer bundled by Crosswalk and should be included explicitly if required.

## Crosswalk 15 (Oct 26, 2015)

* Rebased to Chromium 44
* Reintroduced support for Android 4.0 which was dropped in Chromium 44
* Preserve local storage when upgrading an existing application from platform webview to Crosswalk
* Support for the `theme-color` meta tag

### Embedding API updates

* XWalkView now uses [`SurfaceView`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView.html) as the default rendering backend. This solves several visual glitches, for example when opening/closing the virtual keyboard, and gives better performance, however it doesn’t support animating the view. If you need to animate the XWalkView, select [`TextureView`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/TextureView.html) as the rendering backend. To change the view type to TextureView, use `XWalkPreferences.setValue(XWalkPreferences.ANIMATABLE_XWALK_VIEW, true)`
* New methods to programmatically zoom the view: [`XWalkView.zoomOut`](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-4171),[`XWalkView.zoomIn`](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-4170), [`XWalkView.zoomBy`](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-4169)
* Override the default DownloadListener with [`XWalkView.setDownloadListener`](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3958)
* New helper class [`XWalkInitializer`](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3971) to initialize XWalkView asynchronously

### Extension framework

JavaScript stub auto-generation for Java extensions on Android [[XWALK-3969](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3969)]

### Size optimizations

The following features were ported from the Crosswalk Lite branch to support better compression of the APK:

* Enable ProGuard for Crosswalk to compress APK size [[XWALK-3854](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3854)]
* LZMA support [[XWALK-3810](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3810)]
* Ability to customize the dialog shown when uncompressing Crosswalk [[XWALK-3475](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3475)]

## Crosswalk 14 (Jul 3, 2015)

* First release [available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xwalk.core&hl=en) in the Google Play Store. Applications can be configured to download it on demand
* Rebased to Chromium 43
* New WebCL API for devices that support OpenCL
* SIMD support for code written in asm.js.

### Embedding API Updates

The Crosswalk XwalkView class has a new method to control whether its surface is placed on top of its window. Note that this only works when XWalkPreferences.ANIMATABLE_XWALK_VIEW is false.

```public void setZOrderOnTop (boolean onTop);```

### Notable bug fixes

The --disk-cache-size command line switch now behaves as expected (bug XWALK-3821)

## Crosswalk 13 (May 11, 2015)

* Rebased to Chromium 42
* First version available via the Cordova Crosswalk Webview plugin
* 64-bit support

* [XWALK-1899] - One XWalkView cannot be displayed on top of another XWalkView
* [XWALK-2132] - XWalk Cordova doesn't seem to set window.navigator.language - always en-US
* [XWALK-2352] - Some methods in XWalkView and XWalkUIClient interface do not support when running “WebAPI/Embeddingapi” on Android OS
* [XWALK-2511] - screen.orientation.lock() fails to return Promise when running “WebAPI/Screenorientation” on Android OS
* [XWALK-2643] - getUserMedia Get low FPS in IA devices
* [XWALK-3308] - transparent webview appears white, fixed in chromium
* [XWALK-3736] - Failed to execute 'start' on 'SpeechRecognition'

## Crosswalk 12 (Mar 17, 2015)

## Embedding API updates

### XWalkView

Set the User Agent string of the application:

    void setUserAgentString(String userAgent)

Use `XWalkView.setBackgroundColor(0)` to make the XWalkView transparent ([XWALK-3308](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3308))

### XWalkUIClient

Notify the host application of a console message.:

    void onConsoleMessage(XWalkView view, String message, int lineNumber, String sourceId, ConsoleMessageType messageType)


## SIMD updates

The [SIMD.js API](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd/) now implements load and store of data types. These APIs allow developers to load or store all or partial elements of SIMD data from or to variable typed arrays and are important for several use cases:


Adds "ByScalar" suffix to shift operations according to the latest [SIMD.js spec](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd/). It clarifies that their shift count is a scalar value, and to make namespace room for adding vector-vector shifts in the future.

    SIMD.int32x4.shiftLeftByScalar
    SIMD.int32x4.shiftRightLogicalByScalar
    SIMD.int32x4.shiftRightArithmeticByScalar

SIMD.js introduces new swizzle and shuffle APIs to rearrange lanes in SIMD data types. They include:

    SIMD.float32x4.swizzle
    SIMD.float32x4.shuffle
    SIMD.float64x2.swizzle
    SIMD.float64x2.shuffle
    SIMD.int32x4.swizzle
    SIMD.int32x4.shuffle

## Crosswalk 11 (Feb 26, 2015)

* Rebased to Chromium 40, which introduces the [Service Worker API](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/).

## SIMD updates

The [SIMD.js API](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd/) now implements load and store of data types. These APIs allow developers to load or store all or partial elements of SIMD data from or to variable typed arrays and are important for several use cases:

1. load/store SIMD data from/to non 16 bytes aligned memory.
1. load/store 1, 2 or 3 float32/int32 packed data structure from/to memory to/from SIMD types.
1. enable Emscripten (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) generated SIMD.js code.

APIs include:

	SIMD.float32x4.load
	SIMD.float32x4.loadX
	SIMD.float32x4.loadXY
	SIMD.float32x4.loadXYZ
	SIMD.float32x4.store
	SIMD.float32x4.storeX
	SIMD.float32x4.storeXY
	SIMD.float32x4.storeXYZ
	SIMD.float64x2.load
	SIMD.float64x2.loadX
	SIMD.float64x2.store
	SIMD.float64x2.storeX
	SIMD.int32x4.load
	SIMD.int32x4.loadX
	SIMD.int32x4.loadXY
	SIMD.int32x4.loadXYZ
	SIMD.int32x4.store
	SIMD.int32x4.storeX
	SIMD.int32x4.storeXY
	SIMD.int32x4.storeXYZ

## Crosswalk 10 (Dec 31, 2014)

* Due to some changes to support multiple profiles, upgrading an application to Crosswalk 9 was causing local storage data to disappear. With Crosswalk 10 the data is migrated correctly ([XWALK-3252](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-3252))

### Extensions framework

* Extension support for Android (except permissions for external extensions). See [documentation] (https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-website/wiki/Writing-a-Crosswalk-Java-Extension-on-Android).
* Improved robustness: better browser and unit tests coverage, fixed race conditions and tons of internal fixes.
* Improved internal extensions execution model: now external extensions run in the main thread.
* Only load Extensions on demand, exactly on the first time they are used on a frame.
* Extensions writers can make use of JS helpers and small libraries by using the "requireNative()" function and the v8tools module.
* Create one Extension Process per Render Process. Now each WebApp will have its own pair of Renderer+Extensions Processes.
