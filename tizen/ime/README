The Tizen OS uses Smart Common Input Method (SCIM) and Input System Framework (ISF)
to manage input method systems. In order to integrate Crosswalk with Tizen ISF,
it is required to implement InputMethod interface provided by Chromium.

This directory contains InputMethod interface realization as well as 
"scim bridge" that connects Tizen input method subsystem with Chromium
InputMethod interface.
