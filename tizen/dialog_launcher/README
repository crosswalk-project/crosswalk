The Tizen Dialog launcher is a UI service that provides DBUS interfaces for
launching EFL-based dialogs and returning results to the caller.

Crosswalk requires several dialogs that should behave and look consistently
with the host platform, and this service provides that for Tizen.

Supported dialogs are listed below:
 * Color chooser
 * Date/Time chooser
 * File chooser
 * Item selector (element)
