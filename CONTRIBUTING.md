# Contributing to Crosswalk

Thanks a lot for contributing to Crosswalk, you rock!

This page lists some guidelines for the contribution process to help you send
an awesome patch that gets reviewed and merged quickly.
[Crosswalk's website](https://crosswalk-project.org/contribute/) also has a
whole section dedicated to this, be sure to check it out.

## License

Crosswalk is licensed under the
[3-clause BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). When you
submit a patch, you agree to license your contribution to Intel under this
license.

## Submitting pull requests

* If it applies, add the platform your change affects in both the commit
  message and the pull request title. For example, _"[Android] Update target
  SDK to android-21"_ or _"[Windows] Add unit test for metadata element
  handler"_.

* If you know them, be sure to mention the people you would like to review your
  patch in a comment. You can check the `OWNERS` files in the tree to know the
  best people to look at your changes.

* Do not use your `master` branch in your pull request. This means you will not
  be able to send multiple pull requests at the same time without changing all
  of them at once, and they will also be changed when you update your branch to
  track Crosswalk's latest changes. Instead, use a separate branch for each
  pull request.

* If someone asks you to make a change to your pull request, **DO NOT** close
  it and open a new one. Instead, make the changes to your branch, amending and
  rebasing when necessary, and then use `git push -f` to push the changes to
  the same branch you have used in your existing pull request.

## Commit messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

* If your pull request fixes an open issue in
  [our bug tracker](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira), please reference it in
  your commit message as well as your pull request message, like this:
  ```
  Fix something.

  Yadda, yadda, yadda.

  BUG=XWALK-123456
  ```
  This way, the issue will be updated when the pull request is sent and, once
  it is merged, the issue will be closed automatically.
  If you simply want the issue to be updated but do **not** want it to be
  closed, use a different construct in your message, like _"Related to:
  XWALK-123"_.

## Coding style

* C++: We follow
  [Chromium's coding style](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style),
  which basically mean's
  [Google's](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html).
  Please take some time to get familiar with it, particularly with the amount
  of space used for indentation and the position of asterisks and braces. If in
  doubt, check the rest of the code around what you are changing.

* Java: We also follow
  [Chromium's guidelines](http://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style/java),
  which are very similar to
  [Android's style guide](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html), so
  there should not be any big surprises.

* Python: Just like
  [Chromium's](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/coding-style), our Python
  code mostly follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the
  exceptions being the amount of space used for indentation (2 instead of 4)
  and the use of `MixedCase` functions and methods instead of
  `lower_case_ones`.
