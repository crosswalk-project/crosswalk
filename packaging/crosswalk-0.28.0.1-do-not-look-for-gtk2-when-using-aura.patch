Since there is no GTK+2 package for Tizen 2.1 Mobile and we already use Aura
instead of GTK+2 directly, there should be no need to look for GTK+2 at all.

Upstreaming this patch depends on a hard GTK+2 dependency on
remoting/remoting.gyp being removed in chromium. It does not affect crosswalk
because we do not have any dependency on remoting.gyp.
