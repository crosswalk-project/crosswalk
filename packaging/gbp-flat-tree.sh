# This script is expected to be run by `git-buildpackage' (called by `gbs
# build') as a postexport hook. Its purpose is to remove the tar file generated
# by `gbs export' with `git archive' and create a new archive with tar itself.
#
# It is helpful in two ways:
# - It automates the generation of a proper archive for RPM builds so that one
#   does not need to create a separate git tree with all sources for `gbs
#   build' to work.
# - Since tar is used, the archive's members all have their actual mtimes as
#   opposed to the time of the git tree-ish passed to `git archive'. This is
#   part of the solution for incremental builds in Tizen: since we use actual
#   file mtimes, they are not rebuilt by `make'.
#
# As a postexport hook, there are two additional environment variables
# available: GBP_GIT_DIR is /path/to/src/xwalk/.git, and GBP_TMP_DIR is the
# temporary directory containing everything in /path/to/src/xwalk/packaging
# that will be copied to $GBSROOT/local/sources and used by `rpmbuild' to build
# an RPM package.
#
# The script is run from GBP_TMP_DIR.

# Fail early to avoid bigger problems later in the process.
