"""An Ant wrapper that suppresses useless Ant output.

Ant build scripts output "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and build timing at the end of
every build. In the Android build, this just adds a lot of useless noise to the
build output. This script forwards its arguments to ant, and prints Ant's
output up until the BUILD SUCCESSFUL line.
