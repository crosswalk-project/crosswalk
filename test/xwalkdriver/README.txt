This file contains high-level info about how XwalkDriver works.

XwalkDriver is an implementation of the WebDriver standard. Part of code is
ported from XwalkDriver.

=====How To=====
For Linux xwalk:
(1) Build XwalkDriver by building the 'xwalkdriver' target and get an executable
binary in the build folder named 'xwalkdriver'.

(2) Build 'xwalk' target, install it in "/opt/crosswalk" or working path of
'xwalkdriver'.

(3) Use following python instructions to do a basic test.

$ export PYTHONPATH=<THIS_DIR>/server:<THIS_DIR>/client
$ python
>>> import server
>>> import xwalkdriver
>>> cd_server = server.Server('/path/to/xwalkdriver/executable')
>>> driver = xwalkdriver.XwalkDriver(cd_server.GetUrl())
>>> driver.Load('http://www.google.com')
>>> driver.Quit()
>>> cd_server.Kill()

For Android xwalk:
It will come soon.

For Tizen xwalk:
It will come soon.
