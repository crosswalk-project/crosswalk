Name: Google code support upload script
Short Name: googlecode_upload
URL: http://support.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scripts/googlecode_upload.py
Version: r681
Security Critical: no
License: Apache 2

Description:
A simple script from Google Code support for automating uploads.

Local modifications:
-Added comment describing license. They have a comment about the license, but
it uses an atypical format that isn't recognized by chromium's checklicense
script.
-Instead of using the default netrc lookup which requires HOME to be set
(which normally isn't on Windows), specify the file using os.path.expanduser.
-Fail instead of prompting for username/password if none is given.
